    "Basic structure has parent and child (can be node structure, though this is not particularly efficient). A **complete binary tree** is where every row but the last is full. \n",

    "## Binary Heap\n",
    "\n",
    "A binary heap is a binary tree with some constraints placed on it. For instance, a min heap means that each parent node has a lesser value than its child node. It does not matter how the children (i.e. siblings) are related--only how parent and child are related. Why do we care about this? We want something that will fit into the priority queue (FIFO) framework. With a binary heap (min heap) the lowest value is always at the top. In a priority queue instead of ``` pop()``` or ``` get()``` you have something like ```int delMin()``` or ```insert(int i)```. When you insert, all you need to check is that the child is a greater value than its parent. If it is not, you swap until that is true for the whole binary tree, giving you a binary heap. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "What if we do a ``` delMin()```? How do we retain heap condition and complete binary tree? We can move the last row, put left child to the top, then move from the top to the lesser of the children, and check to do an exchange (and so on).  \n"

    "## Binary Heap w/ Array Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "For an array, we leave the zeroth element blank, and put the highest parent as the first element. The next two elements after this are the left and right child. The basic idea for filling up the rest of the array is the following: child nodes of parent with index \"i\" are at index \"2i\" and \"2i + 1\". This follows because we have a complete tree. \n",
