    "Suppose you have a list of cities (unsorted) but sorted on time. You can use a stable sort to sort the cities, while keeping the times still sorted (think departure time displays at airports). **mergesort** is a stable sort, **heapsort** is not a stable sort. \n"

Now we are assuming that we have some array a[], which we divide into parts (old a[], old b[]) and we allocate space to merge these sorted parts in aux (old c[]). O(NlogN) algorithm. \n",
